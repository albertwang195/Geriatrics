    "abstract: Releasing a hit song can provide a huge boost to a music artist’s career. Using data with the audio features of 700 songs on Spotify, we built a linear regression model that predicts the popularity of a song on Spotify based on these characteristics, such as loudness, acousticness, and duration, among others. After performing variable selection and introducing transformation and interaction terms, we arrived at a model with a satisfactory performance level. Our results indicate that energy, loudness, and danceability contribute to song popularity, while duration and acousticness detract from it. We also introduced regularization to prevent overfitting. The strength of our results are limited by the small size of the dataset and its timeliness; the dataset was last updated 3 years ago and with the music industry constantly evolving, these results may not be extrapolatable to songs a decade from now. In addition, the determination of the ‘popularity’ value as determined by Spotify is a black box, with no concrete knowledge of how Spotify calculates it. So, our results serve as a general guideline rather than a hard rule.\n",

    "As a group, we have many interests in music at different levels. Our perspectives range from aspiring music industry professionals, to producers and learning DJs, to just music enjoyers. The general population follows a similar story to ours: they are either interested in behind the scenes work, creating music, or they simply enjoy listening to music. \n",

    "The music industry is a multi-billion dollar business where everyone is involved. The creative, the administration behind the creative, and the consumer are all integral to the industry’s success. With music streaming being the most popular way of music consumption, and the ease of accessibility, it’s very difficult to break out of the mold and stand apart from the rest of the pack. \n",

    "Spotify, being the most popular music streaming platform, has its own internal system for categorizing features of songs with numerical values. To create a profitable song, it must be popular. With this in mind, we wanted to create a regression model that can predict what songwriting and textural features musicians can employ to make their songs more popular, therefore increasing their chances of a profitable track."

    "\n",
    "Based on our model and insights, our recommendation to our stakeholders is to focus more on creating or marketing songs that have more energy, danceability, and loudness. These features help boost the popularity of a track. Songs with these features are those that you would hear at clubs; they are loud and good to dance to. Shorter songs are shown to be more popular, along with songs that have less acoustic instrumentation. With this insight, we also recommend decreasing the duration and acousticness as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the final model, all of our predictor variables and their interactions are significant predictors of song popularity. With the test MAE performing better than the training MAE, we see that there is not overfitting, so our regression model will be reasonable for prediction. This is especially promising given the MAE metrics for previous attempts to predict song popularity. Our metric and model outperforms their’s, namely the Peker model, which obtained an MAE of 13.24.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given how noisy the actual Spotify API data is, and the limitations of our dataset with its limited observations and data no later than 2019, we will not give a specific value to reach for each feature, and testing the model with current data from songs released in 2022 and 2023 will give better insights into the timelessness of our model. Even so, we believe that with many decades of data, and a solid performance of the model, our recommendation to the stakeholders remains to emphasize energy, danceability, and loudness, and to decrease duration and acousticness.\n"
