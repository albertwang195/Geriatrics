In order to run Spotify API scraping notebook, will need own API credentials.

Questions for Emre Feb 24:
1) Should we be concerned about the kaggle data being cherrypicked? The trends are way more observable than any data that was scraped from the API, which raises concerns.
2) How should we interpret our RMSE in the context of determining a "good" model? Since the popularity metric is a black box (Spotify is secretive about it), it's hard to say what is a good RMSE.
